**[UncommonGood](https://uncommongood.io/ "Visit the UncommonGood website")** is a cloud-based software solution that helps nonprofits do more good every day by eliminating inefficiencies and providing nonprofits with modern technology. UncommonGood was founded on the idea that nonprofit organizations should have access to the same high-quality tools and resources as for-profit companies, without having to spend half their budget on them. By providing an all-inclusive platform for nonprofits to manage their operations, marketing, and fundraising efforts, UncommonGood enables nonprofits to focus more on what matters, doing good.
